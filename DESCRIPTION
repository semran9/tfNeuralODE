Description: Provides a framework for the creation and use of Neural ordinary
    differential equations with R Tensorflow and Keras. The idea of Neural 
    ordinary differential equations come from <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1806.07366>,
    and present a novel way of learning differential systems from data.
