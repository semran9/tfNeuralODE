Description: Provides a framework for the creation and use of Neural ordinary
    differential equations with the 'tensorflow' and 'keras' packages. 
    The idea of Neural ordinary differential equations comes from 
    Chen et al. (2018) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1806.07366>, and 
    presents a novel way of learning and solving differential systems.
