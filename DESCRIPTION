Title: Use R Tensorflow to create Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Shayaan Emran
Maintainer: Shayaan Emran <shayaan.emran@gmail.com>
Description: This package implements a framework for the use of Neural ODEs with 
    R Tensorflow. The concept of Neural ODEs come from <doi:10.48550/arXiv.1806.07366>,
    and present a novel way of using differential systems to model data.
