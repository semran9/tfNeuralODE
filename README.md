# tfNeuralODE

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of tfNeuralODE is to provide an easy framework surrounding the
use of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations in R. This package does so
by building on top of R Tensorflow, to help wth auto-differentiation and
the construction of neural network models with Keras. Examples of this
package in use can be found on the project website.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tfNeuralODE like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/semran9/tfNeuralODE.git")
```
